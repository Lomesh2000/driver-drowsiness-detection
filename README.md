# MODEL ARCHITECTURE
![](images-gifs/new_model.jpg.png)

# Algorithm 
Here we are keeping a score(with a variable `score`) for the closed and opened eye predicted frames by the model.
`score` variable is decreased by 1 when opened eyes are predicted and increased by 1 if closed eyes are predicted.
If model predicted five consecutive `drowsy`(or closed eyes) frames then it will raise an alarm and will give a warning 


### Execution 🐉
To run the code, type `python app.py`
